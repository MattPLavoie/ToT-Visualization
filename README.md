# ToT-Visualization

This project is a small single page app that uses the Tabs on Tallahassee (https://tabsontallahassee.com) API to display a list of bills in the Florida legislature and the statistics of the votes that have occured for each bill.

It was created as past of the Tabs on Tallahassee hackathon put on by the Orlando Sentinel and Code for Orlando.
